# pyzule-rw / cyan

rewriting [pyzule](https://github.com/asdfzxcvbn/pyzule), but actually good this time! btw.. cyan/pyzule looks best with a monospace font !! :D

this is pretty much just a hobby project that i'll work on when i'm bored. pyzule in its current state is kinda ugly, but it works and i haven't really had the motivation to work on it. there really isn't any need for improvements, anyway..

`cyan` will ~~target python v3.12 (finally!)~~, be pep8-compliant (hopefully..), and be type-hinted!

## notes

cyan is pretty much "v1.0" now i guess. injection works and is stable, and iOS (should..) have all the right fixes for running cyan, however a bug in python3.9 from procursus prevents it from running.

so to reaffirm this, **iOS is currently not supported until an updated python for iOS gets released**

easiest install ever, just `pip install -U git+https://github.com/asdfzxcvbn/pyzule-rw.git#egg=cyan`
