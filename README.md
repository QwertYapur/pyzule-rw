# pyzule-rw / cyan

rewriting [pyzule](https://github.com/asdfzxcvbn/pyzule), but actually good this time! btw.. cyan/pyzule looks best with a monospace font !! :D

this is pretty much just a hobby project that i'll work on when i'm bored. pyzule in its current state is kinda ugly, but it works and i haven't really had the motivation to work on it. there really isn't any need for improvements, anyway..

`cyan` will target python v3.12 (finally!), be pep8-compliant (hopefully..), and be type-hinted!

## plan

- have a __main__ file ofc, this is what `cyan` command runs
- also have a cyan file, it should have the main logic of the program
- have other files for a class of the ipa/app, main executable, etc
