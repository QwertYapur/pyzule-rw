# pyzule-rw

rewriting [pyzule](https://github.com/asdfzxcvbn/pyzule), but actually good this time! 

this is pretty much just a hobby project that i'll work on when i'm bored. pyzule in its current state is kinda ugly, but it works and i haven't really had the motivation to work on it. there really isn't any need for improvements, anyway..

`pyzule-rw` will target python v3.12 (finally!), be pep8-compliant (hopefully..), and be statically typed!
